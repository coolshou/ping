ping
====

[![Build Status][build_status]][build]

This is a rather basic implementation of the `ping` command in C. It was
created for learning more about raw sockets and how ping works (and for fun).

Features:

* Cross-platform: can compile and run on Windows, Linux, macOS, *BSD
* Supports IPv6
* Displays time with microsecond precision

Example usage:

```sh
$ ./ping google.com
PING google.com (142.250.74.206)
Received reply from 142.250.74.206: seq=0, time=103.307 ms
Received reply from 142.250.74.206: seq=1, time=91.200 ms

^C
```

`ping` accepts only one argument - the name of the host to ping.

Building
--------

To build ping you'll need a C89 compiler and CMake. Supported platforms include
Linux, Mac OS X, Windows (MSVC, Cygwin, MinGW), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
Solaris.

After you cloned this repo run the following commands to build an executable:

```sh
cd ping
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
```

Running
-------

Use of raw sockets usually requires administrative privileges, therefore you
will need to run `ping` as root:

```sh
sudo ./ping google.com
```

There is also a way to make it run without typing `sudo` every time: set the
`suid` bit on the executable and change its owner to `root`:

```sh
sudo chmod +s ./ping
sudo chown root ./ping
```

After starting `ping`, it will run indefinitely until you interrupt it, e.g.
by doing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal.

Scripts
-------

The `scripts` directory contains a couple of scripts to aid debugging:

* `capture.sh` - captures ICMP traffic with `tcpdump` and saves it to
  `ping.pcap` (needs to be run as root)
* `dump.sh` - prints the contents of `ping.pcap` in a nice form (`tcpdump`
   may actually display helpful errors there, like a miscalculated checksum)
